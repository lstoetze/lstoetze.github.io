<title>Weighting Parties and Coalitions: How Coalition Signals Influence Voting Behavior &#8211; Academic Website</title>
<meta name="description" content="Democratic accountability is characterized as weak in political systems
where voters do not get to choose their government directly. We argue
that coalition signals about desirable and undesirable coalitions that
might be formed after the election help to provide this essential aspect of
democratic government. We propose a simple model that identifies the
effect of coalition signals on individual vote decisions. Based on survey
experiments in two different countries we show how coalition signals
change the relative weight of voters’ party and coalition considerations.
Coalition signals increase the importance of coalition considerations
and, at the same time, decrease the importance of party considerations
in voters’ decision calculus, leading some voters to change their vote
intention.
