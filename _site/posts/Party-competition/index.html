<title>Party competition with endogenous policy-preferences &#8211; Academic Website</title>
<meta name="description" content="Formal models of party competition typically assume that voters’ policy preferences are exogenously given. However, many political scientists find this assumption implausible. Parties and political elites can have a substantial influence on citizens political preferences. Two particular mechanisms stand out. First, some voters might be persuaded by a party’s position-taking and adjust their policy preferences accordingly. Second, some voters might project a party’s position closer to their own policy preference than other voters. In this paper we study a party competition in the presence of persuasion and projection effects. We conceptualize the two mechanisms, and derive conditions under which we expect a different outcomes compared to the standard model. Or results indicate that modeling persuasion and projection is crucial in understanding the platform locations in electoral democracies.
