Together with Thomas Gschwend, Simon Munzert, Marcel Neunhoeffer and Sebastian Sternberg I designed a website that publishes forecast for the German Federal Election of 2017. Our model combines historical information about German elections with current Poll data. Our aim is to accompany the campaign for the 2017 Bundestag election with scientifically sound forecasts. You will find the website here: <a href="http://zweitstimme.org">[zweitstimme.org] </a>
