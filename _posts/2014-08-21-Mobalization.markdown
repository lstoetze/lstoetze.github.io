Liberal democratic theory conceptualizes electoral competition as competition over policy. Yet we observe
that many campaigns in modern democracies are not only about policy. Instead, many candidates spent
notable time and effort to advertise so called valence aspects, such as their personal traits, characteristics
and abilities. This paper presents a model of campaigns herethetics that explains why and under which
circumstances candidates have incentives to run valence campaigns. Our model produces predictions
in line with Riker’s dominance principle: candidates whose valence advantage is larger than their
policy advantage should focus more on valence than on policy aspects. These expectations are tested
with individual and campaign level data on the 2008 US Congressional Elections, introducing a novel
way to quantify electoral advantages. We find that candidates tend to broadcast more valence-related
TV ads if their valence advantage is larger than their policy advantage.
