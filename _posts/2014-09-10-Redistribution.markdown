title:  "The effect of immigration on support for redistribution re-examined: survey experiments in three European countries"

In times of increased globalization and ’europeanization’ scholars put considerable effort
into understanding the consequences of immigration for the welfare state. We argue that
groups within a society react quite differently to increasing immigration. Citizens with high
income are especially likely to withdraw their support for redistribution because they want to
prevent higher redistribution to the “out group” of new immigrants. Other parts of the society
ask for stronger compensation due to the increased (labour market) risks of immigration. Based
on a new survey experiment in three countries, we show that both income as well as labour
competition moderate the overall negative effect of increasing migration. While respondents
with high income withdraw their support, respondents who face strong labour competition
increase their support.
