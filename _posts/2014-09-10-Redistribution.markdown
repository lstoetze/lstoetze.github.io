In times of increasing globalization scholars put considerable effort into understanding the consequences of immigration for the welfare state. One important factor in this respect is public support for the welfare state and redistribution. This article presents results from a unique survey experiment and a panel study in three European countries (Norway, Germany, and the Netherlands) to examine whether and how individuals change their preference for redistribution when faced with immigration.  Theoretically, citizens with high income should be especially likely to withdraw their support for redistribution because they fear the increased fiscal burden, whereas other types of citizens might ask for more compensation for the increased labour market risks caused by immigration. The empirical evidence reveals that only respondents with high income and those who face low labour market competition withdraw support for redistribution when faced with immigration.
