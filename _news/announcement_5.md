New publication in [Research and Politics](https://doi.org/10.1177/20531680231183512), in which we present the PARTYPRESS Database. The Database compiles more than 250,000 published press releases from 68 parties in 9 European countries. It covers the press releases of the most relevant political parties in these countries from 2010 onward and provides a supervised machine learning classification of press releases into 21 unique issue categories.
