In the research project with Heike Klüver, Johannes Giesecke, and Martin Kroh at the SCRIPTS Cluster of Excellence we study the interplay between social inequalities, migration, and populism. 

## Description

The projects seek to examine the roles that socio-economic inequality, migration, and party communication play in the rise of European populist parties. The overarching hypothesis is that populist parties – in order to mobilize voters – have exploited (perceived) inequalities and recent migration trends in their campaign strategies. To speak to this overarching theme, the research project has four pillars. First, we study how inequality leads voters to support populist parties. Second, we study how migration inflows influence voters’ decisions. Third, we conduct research on polarization (both affective and ideological). Finally, we study what issues parties stress in their communication efforts and what issues populist parties focus on.
