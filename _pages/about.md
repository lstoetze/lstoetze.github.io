I am a Professor of Quantitative Methods at the Department of Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the [University of Witten/Herdecke](https://www.uni-wh.de). 

Before I worked at the [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/), at the excellence cluster [SCRIPTS](https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/), at the [Department of Political Science at University of Zurich](https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/en.html), and a as Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Political Science](https://polisci.mit.edu/), on a project that was funded by the [Fritz-Thyssen Foundation](https://www.fritz-thyssen-stiftung.de/). I graduated from University of Mannheim at the [Graduate School of Economic & Social Sciences](https://gess.uni-mannheim.de/) in May 2015. 

My research in quantitative methods focuses on the application of causal inference and measurement methods. My subtantial area of research pertains to understanding political behaviour and its consequences in representative democracies. To find answers to the question how votersâ€™ behaviour influences democratic quality, I develop quantitative research methods and build on formal theoretical decision making processes.
