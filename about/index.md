I am a Postdoc at the Department of Political Science at University of Zurich. Before arriving in Zurich, I worked as Postdoctoral Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Political Science, on a project that was funded by the Fritz-Thyssen Foundation. I graduated from University of Mannheim at the Graduate School of Economic & Social Sciences in May 2015. During my doctoral studies, I lectured and thought at the Chair of Quantitative Methods. 

My broader research interest is in political behavior and political methodology. In my dissertation I analyzed the electoral consequences of relaxing major assumptions of ideology based voting models. My research focuses on applied statistical modeling, in particular in the field of item-response models, choice models, and Bayesian inference. In a recent publication in Political Analysis, co-authored with Steffen Zittlau, I implement a correct specification of the weighted euclidean distance spatial voting model, allowing for non-separability of preferences over multiple dimensions. In a paper accepted for publication at the Journal of Politics, together with Thomas Gschwend and Michael Meffert, I extend strategic choice models to estimate the potential priming effect of coalition signals.
