I am Political Science Post-doc at the University of Mannheim.  For a living I work as a Lecturer and Researcher at the Chair of Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences.  I graduated at the Graduate School of Economic & Social Sciences. My broader research interest is in voting behavior and political methodology. In my dissertation I analyze the electoral consequences of relaxing major assumptions of ideology based voting models.

I have a special interest in applied statistical modeling, in particular in the field of item-response models, choice models, and Bayesian inference. This is reflected in numerous working papers. In a co-authored paper, I extend strategic choice models to estimate the potential priming effect of coalition signals. In joined working paper, we implement a correct specification of the weighted euclidean distance spatial voting model, allowing for non-separability of preferences over multiple dimensions.
