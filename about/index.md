I am Political Science Postdoctoral Fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Political Science.  Prior to Post-doc, I worked as a Lecturer and Researcher at the Chair of Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences at University of Mannheim. I also graduated in Mannheim at the Graduate School of Economic & Social Sciences May, 2015. My broader research interest is in voting behavior and political methodology. In my dissertation I analyzed the electoral consequences of relaxing major assumptions of ideology based voting models.

I have a special interest in applied statistical modeling, in particular in the field of item-response models, choice models, and Bayesian inference. In recent publication in Political Analysis, we implement a correct specification of the weighted euclidean distance spatial voting model, allowing for non-separability of preferences over multiple dimensions. In a co-authored paper that is currently under review, we extend strategic choice models to estimate the potential priming effect of coalition signals.
